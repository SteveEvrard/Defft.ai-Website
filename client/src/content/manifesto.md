# The Defft.ai Manifesto

We believe packaging distribution is broken. Not because the people are broken, but because the system they are forced to use is broken.

We believe the future of this industry lies not in warehouses, trucks, or catalogs, but in **intelligence**.

We believe the scoreboard must evolve. We reject the idea that "more calls" equals "more sales." We reject the "Guesswork Tax" that drains millions from the bottom line.

We commit to a new truth: **The System of Recommendation.**

We refuse to settle for software that just records what happened. We demand software that tells you **what to do next**.

We believe that when you combine human creativity with machine intelligence, you don't just get efficiency. You get **superpowers**.

This is our call to arms. To stop guessing. To stop searching. To start knowing.

**Defft.ai is the System of Recommendation.**
