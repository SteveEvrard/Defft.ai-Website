# The Category: System of Recommendation™

**System of Recommendation (SoR)** is a new category of software that transforms packaging distributors from reactive order-takers into proactive consultants. SoR shifts the core workflow from "searching for answers" to "reviewing recommendations," transforming the sales rep from a hunter into a sniper.

## The Problem: The Guesswork Tax
Most distributors run on ERP (what happened) and CRM (who we know). But neither tells a rep **what to sell right now**.
*   **Tribal Knowledge is a Liability:** When your best rep leaves, their brain leaves. That's a single point of failure.
*   **The Search Tax:** Reps spend 40% of their week searching for specs, pricing, and vendors. That's 16 hours of lost revenue per rep, per week.
*   **Reactive Selling:** You wait for the phone to ring. You quote what they asked for, not what they need. You leave margin on the table.

## The Solution: Compounding Intelligence
A System of Recommendation doesn't just store data; it **thinks**. It ingests your history, your vendors, and your market data to generate the **60-Second Interaction**: the perfect product, price, and pitch, served on a silver platter.

## The From-To Shift

| Old Way (ERP + CRM) | New Way (System of Recommendation) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Reactive:** Wait for the RFQ | **Proactive:** Pitch before they ask |
| **Tribal Knowledge:** In the rep's head | **Institutional Intelligence:** In the system |
| **Manual Search:** 4 hours/day | **Instant Answers:** 60 seconds |
| **Flat Data:** Rows and columns | **Knowledge Graph:** Relationships and context |
| **Vendor Management:** Rolodex | **Supply Chain Intelligence:** Live matching |

## The Scoreboard
*   **Recommendation Acceptance Rate:** How often do reps say "yes" to the AI?
*   **Time-to-Quote:** From days to minutes.
*   **Margin Lift:** The premium earned by selling value, not commodities.
