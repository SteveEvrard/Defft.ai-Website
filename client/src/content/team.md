# The Team: The Insider & The Iconoclast

Great categories are never built by consensus. They are built by the collision of two opposing forces: deep, painful domain expertise and radical, iconoclastic disruption.

Defft.ai was born from such a collision.

## Miodrag "Mio" Minic: The Insider
**The Soul of the System.**
Mio isn't just a packaging expert; he's a pioneer who has lived the problem. A native of Nis, Serbia, Mio made history as the first Serbian to captain the basketball team at Morehouse College, an HBCU where he learned the power of legacy, leadership, and defying expectations.

He spent years inside the packaging industry (Pregis), witnessing firsthand the "Guesswork Tax" that plagues every distributor. He saw brilliant reps burning out, margins leaking, and sustainability goals failing—not for lack of effort, but for lack of intelligence. He knew the industry needed a brain.

## Eric Spitz: The Iconoclast
**The Architect of the Future.**
Eric doesn't fix industries; he reimagines them. A serial entrepreneur and self-described "Iconoclast," Eric has spent his career smashing idols in media (Orange County Register), sports tech, and cannabis (C4 Distro, Rootz.ai).

He saw packaging not as a boring logistics problem, but as a massive, unorganized data set waiting to be unlocked. Where others saw boxes, Eric saw a "System of Recommendation." He brought the outsider's ruthlessness to an insider's problem.

## The Origin Story
They didn't meet at a tech mixer. They met across a negotiation table, trying to talk their way out of a "certain situation." It was high stakes. It was tense. And in that crucible, they realized they were the only two people in the room who saw the world the same way.

They realized that by combining Mio's deep empathy for the rep with Eric's ruthless architectural vision, they could build something that didn't just improve the industry, but redefined it.

**Defft.ai is their handshake.**
